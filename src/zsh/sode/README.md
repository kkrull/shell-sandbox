# `sode`

That's 'sode', as in [BRODESODE](https://youtu.be/Cx8sl2uC46A?si=6hLK3-kPXTf-7owI).  If you know,
you know.

`sode` is a wrapper providing one-stop shopping for all my hacking needs.  It's structured like Git,
but with references to healthier recreational activities.  Thusly when you find yourself confronted
by deadly (computing-related) scenarios, take out your brode sode and hack away at it until it stops
moving.

For a much more dull–but perhaps more enlightening–description: This is a top-level command that I
can use to invoke other commands that do various things I'm experimenting with.  Scripts proving to
be sufficiently useful may later graduate to–or re-spawn–in other repositories.  So this is an
incubator for stuff I think may be worth automating, but that doesn't merit its own repository just
yet.
