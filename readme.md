# Shell Script Sandbox

Scripts for things I got tired of doing myself.

- [`src/bash/`](./src/bash/README.md): Scripts I wrote in bash, before I was dragged into the warmth of
  the 21st century and learned `zsh`.
- [`src/zsh/`](./src/zsh/README.md): Scripts in `zsh`, including the world-renowned
  [`sode`](./src/zsh/sode/README.md)
